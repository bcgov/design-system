# B.C. Design System [![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Maturing-007EC6)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Effective November 12, 2025, we are resuming development of the design system. If you have questions or ideas, email [designsystem@gov.bc.ca](mailto:designsystem@gov.bc.ca) or [open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues).


The B.C. Design System gives design and software development teams the building blocks to deliver intuitive, accessible digital services.

The B.C. Design System comprises 4 core elements:

- [Design tokens](#bc-design-tokens)
- [Figma and React component libraries](#component-library)
- [Documentation hub](https://gov.bc.ca/designsystem)

The new design system replaces [the legacy design system](#legacy-documentation), which has now been archived.

## B.C. Design Tokens

The [B.C. Design Tokens package](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/docs/packages/design-tokens) provides a method to quickly and consistently implement the province's look and feel for digital services. They offer a set of standardized options to help developers style user interfaces in a consistent and future-proof way.

- [Installable package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens)
- [Source code](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/main/packages/design-tokens)
- [Figma library](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=8E36BE1D10E04A17B0CD4D913FA7AC43#designers)
- [Design tokens docs](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5993A3D597F1454CB0E5DFA02DBB2EB7)

## Component library

The component library provides an inventory of reusable UI components, implemented in Figma and React. Support for other languages and frameworks is currently out-of-scope.

The component library is currently in active development. New components are added when both Figma and React implementations are complete and fully documented.
