> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently being redeveloped. If you have questions, [contact the design system team](#contact) or [open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues).

The B.C. Design System will give design and software development teams the building blocks to deliver intuitive, accessible digital services. 

It will replace [the legacy design system](#legacy-documentation). The legacy design system will eventually be deprecated and archived.

## B.C. Design Tokens

The [B.C. Design Tokens package](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/docs/packages/design-tokens) is the first release as part of the new design system.

Design tokens provide a method to quickly and consistently implement the province's look and feel for digital services. They offer a set of standardized options to help developers style user interfaces in a consistent and future-proof way.

## Legacy documentation
> [!WARNING]
> This content and the associated code and assets are no longer supported.

The Design System helps developers and designers build better digital products and services.

It’s a collection of digital resources and tools – including a library of reusable UI/interface components and design patterns. The system makes it easier and faster to build custom B.C. government websites and applications.

Components are collectively built by the government community, meet accessibility standards and are open for input and improvement.
