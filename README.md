# B.C. Design System [![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Maturing-007EC6)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

> [!NOTE] > **April 2024**: The B.C. Design System is currently in active development. If you have questions, [contact the design system team](#contact) or [open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues).

The B.C. Design System will give design and software development teams the building blocks to deliver intuitive, accessible digital services.

The B.C. Design System comprises 4 core elements:

- [Design tokens](#bc-design-tokens)
- [React component library](#component-library) (in development)
- Design library in Figma (in development)
- [Documentation hub](https://gov.bc.ca/designsystem)

The new design system replaces [the legacy design system](#legacy-documentation), which has now been archived.

## B.C. Design Tokens

The [B.C. Design Tokens package](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/docs/packages/design-tokens) is the first release as part of the new design system.

Design tokens provide a method to quickly and consistently implement the province's look and feel for digital services. They offer a set of standardized options to help developers style user interfaces in a consistent and future-proof way.

- [Installable package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens)
- [Source code](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/main/packages/design-tokens)
- [Figma library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1326994583954765832)

## Component library

The component library will provide an inventory of reusable UI components, including:

- Reusable components in Figma
- Reference implementations in React

Support for other languages and frameworks is currently out-of-scope.

The component library is currently in active development. A [developer preview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-system-react-components) of the React library is published on npm.
