# B.C. Design System [![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Maturing-007EC6)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

> [!NOTE]
> **July 2024**: The B.C. Design System is currently in active development. If you have questions, [contact the design system team](#contact) or [open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues).

The B.C. Design System gives design and software development teams the building blocks to deliver intuitive, accessible digital services.

The B.C. Design System comprises 4 core elements:

- [Design tokens](#bc-design-tokens)
- [Figma and React component libraries](#component-library)
- [Documentation hub](https://gov.bc.ca/designsystem)

The new design system replaces [the legacy design system](#legacy-documentation), which has now been archived.

## B.C. Design Tokens

The [B.C. Design Tokens package](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/docs/packages/design-tokens) provides a method to quickly and consistently implement the province's look and feel for digital services. They offer a set of standardized options to help developers style user interfaces in a consistent and future-proof way.

- [Installable package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens)
- [Source code](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/main/packages/design-tokens)
- [Figma library](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=8E36BE1D10E04A17B0CD4D913FA7AC43#designers)
- [Design tokens docs](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5993A3D597F1454CB0E5DFA02DBB2EB7)

## Component library

The component library provides an inventory of reusable UI components, implemented in Figma and React. Support for other languages and frameworks is currently out-of-scope.

The component library is currently in active development. New components are added when both Figma and React implementations are complete and fully documented.

- [Installable package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-system-react-components)
- [Source code](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/tree/main/packages/react-components)
- [Storybook UI workshop](https://designsystem.gov.bc.ca/react-components/)
- [Figma library](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=8E36BE1D10E04A17B0CD4D913FA7AC43#designers)
