This component is based on the React Aria [Disclosure](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Disclosure.html) and [DisclosureGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DisclosureGroup.html) components. Consult the React Aria documentation for additional technical information.

### Anatomy

An Accordion can be used singularly, or wrapped inside an AccordionGroup.

AccordionGroup expects some number of Accordions, passed as children:

```javascript
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion>Some content</Accordion>
  <Accordion />
  <Accordion />
</AccordionGroup>
```

## Controls

### Accordion

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.AccordionTemplate} />
<Controls of={AccordionStories.AccordionTemplate} />

### AccordionGroup

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupTemplate} />
<Controls of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupTemplate} />

## Configuration

### Populating content in an accordion

Set the title for an accordion item using the `label` prop. Use the `id` prop to set a unique identifier for an accordion.

Populate an accordion's content using the `children` slot. Content in the `children` slot is rendered inside a container with the `bcds-react-aria-Disclosure--Panel` CSS class.

### Creating an accordion group

Pass accordion components to the `children` slot of an accordion group.

Set a title for the group using the `title` prop. By default, the title renders in a `<span>`:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupWithDefaultTitle} />

Use `titleElement` to set an alternative heading style (accepts `"h1"` to `"h6"`):

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupWithHeading} />

### Single or multiple expansion

By default, an accordion group allows only one item to be opened at a time. When the user opens a second item, the first is automatically closed.

Pass `allowsMultipleExpanded` to allow multiple accordions to be opened simultaneously:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.MultipleOpenAccordion} />

### Expanding items by default

If an accordion group is uncontrolled, use the `defaultExpandedKeys` prop (expects an array of accordion `id` values) to make individual items open by default:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.UncontrolledDefaultExpanded} />

If an accordion group's state is controlled, use the `expandedKeys` prop instead.

### Disabled items

Pass `isDisabled` to an Accordion to disable an individual item:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupWithDisabledItem} />

Pass `isDisabled` to an AccordionGroup to disable the entire group:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.DisabledAccordionGroup} />
