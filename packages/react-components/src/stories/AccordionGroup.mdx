This component is based on the React Aria [Disclosure](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Disclosure.html) and [DisclosureGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DisclosureGroup.html) components. Consult the React Aria documentation for additional technical information.

### Anatomy

An Accordion can be used singularly, or wrapped inside an AccordionGroup.

AccordionGroup expects some number of Accordions, passed as children:

```javascript
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion />
  <Accordion />
  <Accordion />
</AccordionGroup>
```

## Controls

### Accordion controls

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.AccordionTemplate} />
<Controls of={AccordionStories.AccordionTemplate} />

### AccordionGroup controls

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupTemplate} />
<Controls of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupTemplate} />

## Configuration

### Expanding items by default

If an accordion group is uncontrolled, use the `defaultExpandedKeys` prop (expects an array of accordion `id` values) to make individual items open by default:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.UncontrolledDefaultExpanded} />

If an accordion group's state is controlled, use the `expandedKeys` prop instead.

### Disabled items

Pass `isDisabled` to an Accordion to disable an individual item:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.AccordionGroupWithDisabledItem} />

Pass `isDisabled` to an AccordionGroup to disable the entire group:

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.DisabledAccordionGroup} />
