# Footer

## Usage and resources

The footer component returns an [HTML `<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer).

If no props are passed to the `<footer/>`, it includes default content that matches [the gov.bc.ca footer](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home#cmf-ui-footer). This content is baked into the component - there is no API request to get content for display. Links use generic `<a>` elements and point to GUID-based permalinks on gov.bc.ca where possible. The year in the copyright field is generated automatically.

## Controls

<Canvas of={FooterStories.FooterDefault} />
<Controls of={FooterStories.FooterDefault} />

### Responsive design

The `links` list will drop below the `logo` and `contact` when there's no longer room for both side by side. The amount of padding in each section is reduced on very small screens.

## Land acknowledgement

You can pass an alternative land acknowledgement using the `acknowledgement` slot.

<Canvas of={FooterStories.LandAcknowledgement} />

## `children`

The central content block of the Footer contains a default logo, contact information text, and a list of links. You can replace all three at once by passing `children`:

<Canvas of={FooterStories.MultipleFooterLinksGroupsInChildrenSlot} />

Alternatively, don't pass a `children` prop, and each of the other props (`logo`, `contact`, `links`) can also be individually replaced as detailed below:

## Logo

The included Government of B.C. SVG logo can be replaced using the `logo` slot.

<Canvas of={FooterStories.Logo} />

## Contact

The contact information block can be replaced using the `contact` slot.

<Canvas of={FooterStories.Contact} />

## Links

The links block can be replaced using the `links` slot. Use the included `<FooterLinks/>` element from this library to get a pre-styled list:

<Canvas of={FooterStories.LinksUsingFooterLinksComponent} />

## Copyright

Pass a string to the `copyright` prop for custom copyright text.

<Canvas of={FooterStories.Copyright} />

## Hide sections

### Hide land acknowledgement section

Hide the land acknowledgement section with the `hideAcknowledgement` boolean prop:

<Canvas of={FooterStories.HideLandAcknowledgement} />

### Hide logo and links section

Hide the middle logo and links section with the `hideLogoAndLinks` boolean prop:

<Canvas of={FooterStories.HideLogoAndLinks} />

### Hide copyright section

Hide the copyright field with the `hideCopyright` boolean prop:

<Canvas of={FooterStories.HideCopyright} />
