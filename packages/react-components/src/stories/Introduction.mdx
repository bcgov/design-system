# B.C. Design System React Components

This is a UI workshop for React components included in the [B.C. Design System](https://gov.bc.ca/designsystem). This app provides:

- Fully rendered, configurable previews of each released component
- Detailed technical docs
- Automated accessibility testing and validation

Use the left-hand navigation pane to browse component docs and rendered previews.

## Install the component library

To start using these components in your project, [install the component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-system-react-components) via npm:

<Source code={`npm install @bcgov/design-system-react-components`} />

### Dependencies

The component library supports [React versions 16.14.0](https://react.dev/versions) and later. It relies on these packages as core dependencies:

- [B.C. Design Tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens) (Government of British Columbia): used to style components
- [BC Sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/bc-sans) (Government of British Columbia): standard font, required for use in B.C. government digital services
- [React Aria Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-aria-components) (Adobe): provides unstyled primitives used as a base for some components

## Design tokens

This library uses [@bcgov/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens) for styling. Design tokens are shipped as CSS and JavaScript variables, and include TypeScript support. Tokens can also be used separately from the component library if needed.

- [Learn more about design tokens](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/digital/design-system/foundations/design-tokens)
- [Developer docs](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/digital/design-system/foundations/design-tokens/developers)
