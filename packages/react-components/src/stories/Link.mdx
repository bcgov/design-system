## Usage and resources

Link is a utility component for creating accessible and configurable hyperlinks within a user interface.

It is based on [React Aria Link](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html). Consult the React Aria documentation for additional technical information.

## Controls

<Primary of={LinkStories} />
<Controls of={LinkStories.LinkTemplate} />

## Configuration

Link text is set via the `children` slot.

You can configure a link's behaviour using the `href` prop to provide a destination URL, or use the `onPress` prop to configure click/press events.

If a link has an `href`, it renders as an `<a>` element. Otherwise, it will render a `<span>` with the ARIA "[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/link_role)" role.

Consult the React Aria documentation for [more information about events and routing](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html#events).

### Overriding link styles

Link ships with styling based on the [B.C. Design System typescale](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=72C2CD6E05494C84B9A072DD9C6A5342). To override this styling, you can:

- Pass your own CSS class with the `className` prop
- Pass the `isUnstyled` prop to remove all CSS, allowing a link to inherit its styles from its parent elements

<Canvas of={LinkStories.LinkInHeading} />

### Size

Use the `size` prop to choose between `small`, `medium` and `large` sizes:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.SmallLink} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.MediumLink} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.LargeLink} />

If no `size` prop is passed, it will default to `medium`.

### Destructive links

Use the `danger` prop to indicate that a link is destructive:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.DangerLink} />

### Disabled links

Pass `isDisabled` to disable a link. A disabled link cannot be focused or interacted with:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.DisabledLink} />

## Button links

Use the `isButton` prop to create a link that looks and behaves like the [Button](/docs/components-button-button--docs) component.

The `buttonVariant` prop to choose between the `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary` button styles:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.PrimaryLinkButton} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.SecondaryLinkButton} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.TertiaryLinkButton} />

If no `buttonVariant` prop is passed, it will default to `primary`. If `isButton` isn't set, `buttonVariant` won't do anything.

You can use the `isDisabled`, `danger` and `size` props as normal:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.DisabledLinkButton} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.DangerLinkButton} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.SmallLinkButton} />
