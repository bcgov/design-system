  resource within your app. They can be used inline within content, or to
  populate navigation menus.

## Usage and resources

Link is a utility component for creating accessible and configurable hyperlinks within a user interface.

It is based on [React Aria Link](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html). Consult the React Aria documentation for additional technical information.

## Controls

<Primary of={LinkStories} />
<Controls of={LinkStories.LinkTemplate} />

## Configuration

Link text is set via the `children` slot.

You can configure a link's behaviour using the `href` prop to provide a destination URL, or use the `onPress` prop to configure click/press events.

If a link has an `href`, it renders as an `<a>` element. Otherwise, it will render a `<span>` with the ARIA "[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/link_role)" role.

Consult the React Aria documentation for [more information about events and routing](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html#events).

### Styling

Link ships with styling based on the [B.C. Design System typescale](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=72C2CD6E05494C84B9A072DD9C6A5342). Pass a CSS class with the `className` prop to override a link's styles with your own.

### Size

Use the `size` prop to choose between `small`, `medium` and `large` sizes:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.SmallLink} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.MediumLink} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.LargeLink} />

If no `size` prop is passed, it will default to `medium`.

Links will match the correct heading style from the design system typescale if enclosed in an element like `<h2>`:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.LinkInHeading} />

### Link icons

You can pass SVG graphics into the `children` slot to add icons to a link:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.LinkWithLeftIcon} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.LinkWithRightIcon} />
<Canvas of={LinkStories.IconOnlyLink} />

**Note**: when using an icon-only link, you must also pass an accessible label for assistive technologies using the `ariaLabel` prop.

### Disabled links

Pass `isDisabled` to disable a link. A disabled link cannot be focused or interacted with:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.DisabledLink} />
