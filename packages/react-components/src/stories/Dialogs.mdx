# Dialogs

<Subtitle>
  Dialogs present important information to the user, and block interaction with
  the rest of the interface until they take an action or dismiss the dialog.

## Usage and resources

The B.C. Design System provides two methods to build an interruptive dialog:

- [Dialog](#dialog): an empty container, in which you can assemble your own UI
- [Alert Dialog](#alert-dialog): a pre-composed dialog template, suitable for common error messages or notifications

Learn more about working with the dialog components:

- [Usage and best practice guidance](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=6A0A247719CA42DDB9B8BAD47D46F69C)
- [View the button component in Figma](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=8E36BE1D10E04A17B0CD4D913FA7AC43#designers)

These components are based on these React Aria components:

- [Modal](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Modal.html)
- [Dialog](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Dialog.html)

Consult the React Aria documentation for additional technical information.

### Anatomy

To create a modal dialog in your UI, you need:

- A `<DialogTrigger>` element
- A trigger event or element (commonly a [button](?path=/docs/components-button-button--docs), positioned as the first child inside a `<DialogTrigger>`)
- A [`<Modal>`](#modal), which creates a blocking overlay over the entire UI when activated
- A [`<Dialog>`](#dialog), placed inside the `<Modal>` and containing some content and/or components

Structurally, these components are assembled like this:

```javascript
<DialogTrigger>
  <Button>This button activates the modal</Button>
  <Modal>
    <Dialog>This dialog contains some content and/or components</Dialog>
  </Modal>
</DialogTrigger>
```

## Modal

<Canvas of={ModalStories.ModalTemplate} />
<Controls of={ModalStories.ModalTemplate} />

When triggered by a `<DialogTrigger>`, a modal renders two components:

- `<ModalOverlay>`: a translucent overlay that covers the entire UI and blocks interaction until it is dismissed
- `<Modal>`: a container element, positioned in the centre of the screen. Expects a [Dialog](#dialog) or [Alert Dialog](#alert-dialog) as children

Use the `isDismissable` prop (defaults to `true`) to control whether the user can dismiss a modal by clicking outside the `<Modal>` container.

Use `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` (defaults to `false`) to control whether the user can dismiss a modal by pressing 'Escape'.

### Controlled state

Instead of using a trigger element inside a `<DialogTrigger>`, you can also [use React Aria's APIs to make a modal's state controlled](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Modal.html#controlled-open-state), and integrate it with your app's business logic and state management approach.

### Styling

You can pass a `style` object to a `Modal` to apply your own styling to the container element:

<Canvas of={ModalStories.CustomSizeModal} />

## Dialog

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DialogTemplate} />
<Controls of={DialogStories.DialogTemplate} />

`Dialog` is a generic content container, that can be used inside a `Modal` (or other patterns like [popovers](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Popover.html).)

You can pass a set of components to the `children` slot to compose your own dialog UI:

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DialogWithForm} />

### Styling

You can pass a `style` object to a `Dialog` to apply custom styling and layout rules. You can also write additional CSS rules for the `.bcds-react-aria-Dialog--Container` class.

## Alert Dialog

An alert dialog is a pre-composed dialog template, suitable for common error messages or notifications that require the user to provide confirmation or take an action before proceeding. [View full docs for the Alert Dialog component.](?path=/docs/components-dialogs-alertdialog--docs)
