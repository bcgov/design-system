## Usage and resources

Form is a utility component that acts as a container for a set of input components. It is based on [React Aria Form](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Form.html).

The Form component renders an HTML `<form>` element, and acts as a [form landmark](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/landmarks/examples/form.html) for accessibility purposes.

Wrapping related input components in a Form enables you to configure validation and submission behaviour for a set of components as a group.

Consult the React Aria documentation for more information about configuring:

- [Events](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Form.html#events)
- [Validation](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Form.html#validation)
- [Props](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Form.html#props)

### Alternative ways to build forms

The Form component is useful for composing simple forms or inputs within your UI. For more complex use cases, the B.C. Public Service maintains two full-featured form builders:

- [Common Hosted Forms Service (CHEFS)](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/bcgov-common-components/common-hosted-form-service/)
- [CMS Forms](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/bcgov-common-components/cms-forms/)

## Styling

The Form component ships with minimal CSS, as its child components will usually have their own styling baked in.

If needed, you can write additional rules for the `.bcds-react-aria-Form` class, or pass a `className` prop to override the styling entirely.

## Example

In this example, the Form component wraps around Select and Button components to compose a simple form.

Button functionality is derived from the `type` prop.

<Controls of={FormStories.ComposedFormExample} />
