# Select

A select displays a collapsible list of options and allows a user to select one of them.

It is built using the [React Aria Select](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Select.html).

## Flat list of items

Options in the select component are implemented using React Aria's [Collection Components API](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/collections.html) via the `items` and `sections` props.

Use the `items` prop to supply a flat array of options to the select component:

<Canvas of={SelectStories.SelectTemplate} />

## Sectioned lists of items

Use the `sections` prop to supply an array of sections that group `items` visually.

Each section object can be labelled with an optional `header`.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Sections} />

## Size

Choose from medium (default) and small select sizes:

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Small} />
<Canvas of={SelectStories.Medium} />

## Required

By default, select fields are not required, and "(optional)" appears in the label. Use `isRequired` to mark the select field as required:

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Required} />

## Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop to disable a select component.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Disabled} />

## Danger

Use the `isDestructive` boolean prop on an item to mark that option as dangerous/destructive (delete actions, actions that can't be undone, etc).

<Canvas of={SelectStories.FlatWithDestructionOption} />

## Icons

Use either or both of the `iconLeft` and `iconRight` slots to add icons to options:

<Canvas of={SelectStories.LeftIcon} />
<Canvas of={SelectStories.RightIcon} />
<Canvas of={SelectStories.BothIcons} />

## Options with labels and descriptions

Use the optional `description` prop on an item to provide more context for the option:

<Canvas of={SelectStories.OptionDescriptions} />

## Placeholder text

The `placeholder` prop can be used for displaying text within the select component before an option is chosen. If `placeholder` isn't passed, the default "Select an item" text will appear.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Placeholder} />
