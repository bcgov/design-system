This component is based on [React Aria RadioGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/RadioGroup.html) and the [Radio](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/RadioGroup.html#radio) subcomponent.

## Controls

<Primary of={RadioGroupStories} />
<Controls of={RadioGroupStories.RadioGroupTemplate} />

## Configuration

A radio group is made up of two components: `RadioGroup` (the parent container) and any number of `Radio` components (each representing a single option.)

To populate a `RadioGroup`, pass an array of `Radio` components to the `children` slot.

### RadioGroup

Use the `label` and `description` props to explain the purpose of an input. If you do not use a visible `label`, you must instead use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to label the input for assistive technologies:

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.RadioGroupTemplate} />

Use `orientation` to toggle a radio group between `vertical` (default) and `horizontal` layouts:

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.HorizontalRadioGroup} />

#### States

Set `isRequired` to mark an input as mandatory, and display an additional "(required)" label:

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.RequiredRadioGroup} />

Use `isDisabled` to disable an entire radio group:

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.DisabledRadioGroup} />

Use `isReadOnly` to lock a radio group to its currently-selected value:

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.ReadOnlyRadioGroup} />

### Radio
