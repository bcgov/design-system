# Toast

<Subtitle>
  A toast is a temporary alert that displays a context-specific message to the user.
  Toasts are non-blocking and disappear automatically after a short period of time.
</Subtitle>

<Source
  code={`import { useToastQueue } from "@bcgov/design-system-react-components";`}
  language="typescript"
/>

## Behaviour

A toast:

- Appears in the bottom-right of the screen
- Expires automatically after a short period of time
- Can be dismissed manually by the user
- Is dismissed automatically if it becomes irrelevant

Multiple toast messages are stacked vertically and dismissed independently.
