This component is based on [React Aria Button](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html). Consult the React Aria documentation for additional technical information.

## Controls

<Primary of={ButtonStories} />
<Controls of={ButtonStories.ButtonTemplate} />

## Configuration

### Variants

Variants let you control the button's look. Available variants include:

- `primary` (default, used for a call to action)
- `secondary`
- `tertiary`
- `link` (button styled like a link)

If no `variant` prop is passed, the button defaults to `primary`.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Link} />

### Size

Choose from medium and small button sizes:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Medium} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Small} />

### Danger

Use the `danger` boolean prop to mark a button that is destructive (delete actions, actions that can't be undone, etc).

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Danger} />

### Icons

Icons can be dropped into the button as React children. You can also get an icon-only square button (fixed width) with the `isIconButton` boolean.

When using an icon-only button, you must also pass an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop to ensure the button is accessible.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Icon} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.RightIcon} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.LeftIcon} />
