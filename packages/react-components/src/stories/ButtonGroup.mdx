## Usage and resources

ButtonGroup is a utility component intended for use when multiple buttons need to be rendered alongside one another. It contains basic styling to ensure proper spacing between the buttons.

ButtonGroup renders a `<div>` with the [ARIA "group" role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/group_role). It expects an array of [buttons](/docs/components-button-button--docs), passed via the `children` prop.

### Example

ButtonGroup is used to populate buttons within the [Inline Alert component](/docs/components-inline-alert-inline-alert--docs):

<Canvas of={InlineAlertStories.AlertWithButtons} />

## Controls

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.ButtonGroupTemplate} />
<Controls of={ButtonGroupStories.ButtonGroupTemplate} />

## Layout

By default, ButtonGroup renders buttons in a horizontal row, starting from the left edge.

### Orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to toggle the orientation of the button group between `horizontal` and `vertical` layouts:

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.VerticalButtonGroup} />

### Alignment

Use the `alignment` prop to set the alignment of the buttons within the group:

- `start` (left or top, depending on orientation)
- `center`
- `end` (right or bottom, depending on orentation)

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.CenteredButtonGroup} />
