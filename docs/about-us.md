## Contribute to the design system

The design system is an open source project. We welcome feedback, ideas or contributions from the design and development communities.

There is currently no formal process for contributing to the design system. To propose a new component or pattern for inclusion, [start a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/discussions).

Before proposing a new component, consult [the design system roadmap](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/digital/design-system/roadmap) to see if your idea is already on our backlog.

If you'd like to contribute design or code, please reach out to us to discuss how we can collaborate most effectively.

For inclusion in the design system, components must be:

- Implemented as a design component in Figma
- Implemented in React, using existing design system and/or [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) components where appropriate
- Fully documented
- Tested to ensure that they meet [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/) Level AA at a minimum
