# Header - Basic

Headers help people understand what the content of the page is about and provide a quick, organized way to reach the main sections of a web page. They appear at the top of a page, above the main body text. The B.C. government header provides a consistent look, feel, and functionality across government sites.

The text in the header should include the site title or service name. If the website is a service, a good name should:

* Use the words users (regular people) use
* Be based on analytics and user research
*	Describe a task not a technology
*	Not need to change when policy or technology changes
*	Include verbs not nouns
*	Not include government department or agency names
*	Not be brand-driven or focused on marketing

Good examples include:
*	Register to Vote
*	Get help with court fees
*	Renew your passport
*	Find an apprenticeship

*Adapted from the UK Government’s Service Naming Guide [https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service]

## Visual

## Use This For

*	All public-facing online B.C. Government content and services.
*	Websites or apps that do not require navigation built into the header.

## Don't Use This For

*	Non-B.C. government online content or services.
*	Consider using an extended header if you have more sections in your website or if you have complex sections that require the use of a larger menu.

## Rationale

The basic header is the current version. It meets all government standards, branding, and accessibility requirements.

## Behaviour

* Clicking on B.C. government logo links the user back to the homepage
* Site title reduces through three increments as the browser window gets smaller
* After third increment the site title disappears completely
* B.C. government logo does not change size or disappear as the browser window gets smaller

## Accessibility

This header has been built according to WCAG 2.0 AA standards and has been successfully tested for the following:

1. Perceivable
  * Alternative text is provided for non-text content (WCAG 1.1.1)
  * Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 1.4.1)
  * Visual presentation of text and images has a contrast ration of at least 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3)
  * Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200% without loss of content or functionality (WCAG 1.4.4)
  * Images of text are only used for pure decoration (WCAG 1.4.9)

2. Operable
  * All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface (WCAG 2.1.1)
  * A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages (WCAG 2.4.1)
  * Headings and Labels describe topic or purpose (WCAG 2.4.6)
  * Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible (WCAG  2.4.7)

3. Understandable
  * The default human language of each web page can be programmatically determined (WCAG 3.1.1)
  * Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated (WCAG 3.2.3)

4. Robust
  * For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined (WCAG 4.1.2)
