> **February 2024:** The contribution criteria and process are currently being redeveloped. An updated backlog will be published soon. If you have questions about how you can contribute to the design system, email <designsystem@gov.bc.ca>.

# How you can contribute
The B.C. Design System needs a strong community behind it to make it successful. You can contribute by reporting bugs, editing documentation, participating in discussions, or even creating new components. Your contribution to it will ensure it helps meets user needs from across the BC government. 

## Discussing styles and components
You can discuss the existing styles and components in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the [component and design pattern backlog](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/projects/1). Alternatively, you can email <designsystem@gov.bc.ca>.

For example, you can:
- ask questions about a style or component
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a component
- share research relating to a style or component

## Propose a new component or pattern
Anyone can propose a new component or pattern for the BC Design System.
To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.

Follow these 2 steps to propose a component or pattern for the Design System.

**1. Check the backlog**

Check if the team has already included the idea in the [backlog](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/projects/1
), or if someone else has already suggested the same idea or something similar.

**2. Raise an issue**

If your idea is not on the backlog, raise an issue using the [Propose a New Component template](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/new/choose). 

## Editing content
If you believe the content on the design system could be written more clearly, raise an issue using the [Content Edit Request template](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/new/choose).

## Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug on the design system, raise an issue using the [Component Bug Report template](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/new/choose)
