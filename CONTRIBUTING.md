# How you can contribute
The BC Design System is for everyone, and needs a strong community behind it to make it successful. There are lots of ways to contribute – reporting bugs, editing documentation, participating in discussions, or even creating new components. Your contribution to it will ensure it helps meets user needs from across the BC government. 

## Discussing styles and components
You can discuss the existing styles and components in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the [component and design pattern backlog](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/projects/1). Alternatively, you can email <designsystem@gov.bc.ca>.

For example, you can:
- ask questions about a style or component
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a component
- share research relating to a style or component

## Propose a new component or pattern
Anyone can propose a new component or pattern for the BC Design System.
To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.

Follow these 2 steps to propose a component or pattern for the Design System.

**1. Check the backlog**

Check if the team has already included the idea in the [backlog](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/projects/1
), or if someone else has already suggested the same idea or something similar.

**2. Raise an issue**

If your idea is not on the backlog, raise an issue using the [Propose a New Component template](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/new/choose). 

## Editing content
If you believe the content on the design system could be written more clearly, raise an issue using the [Content Edit Request template](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/new/choose).

## Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug on the design system, raise an issue using the [Component Bug Report template](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues/new/choose)
