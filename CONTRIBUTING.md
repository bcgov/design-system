# Contribute to the B.C. Design System

The B.C. Design System is a resource for all designers and developers in the B.C. Public Service. Your ideas, feedback and support are essential to making it successful.

The design system is maintained by the Online Service Solutions team at Service BC, part of the Ministry of Citizens' Services. You can contact the team by email at [designsystem@gov.bc.ca](mailto:designsystem@gov.bc.ca).

## Suggest a new component or pattern

To propose a new component or pattern for inclusion in the design system, [open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues) using the 'New component' template.

We evaluate prospective new components based on:

- Demonstrable impact in terms of functionality or usability of government digital service
- Evidence that the functional need can't be met using existing components
- Demand from the user community

Before suggesting a new component, first [check the roadmap](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/digital/design-system/roadmap). It may already be in our backlog.

## Contribute code or design

We welcome pull requests to fix issues in the codebase. Proposed changes should be fully documented, explaining:

- The problem and its impact for the user
- The rationale behind the proposed solution

If you'd like to contribute a larger feature (for example, a new component), we suggest that you reach out to us first to discuss it and agree a path forward.

Before release, all components must have:

- A Figma component and design specification
- A React component, using [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) as a base (where applicable)
- Technical documentation and examples in [Storybook](https://designsystem.gov.bc.ca/react-components/)

All components must also undergo both human and automated accessibility testing, to ensure they conform to [WCAG 2.2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) at a minimum.

## Report a bug or ask a question

If you encounter bugs or other issues using the design system, please let us know. You can:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/issues) using the 'Bug' template (recommended)
- [Email designsystem@gov.bc.ca](mailto:designsystem@gov.bc.ca)
